Recolt datas by post and page with post_meta and display it with the Api Google chart on each post and page

== Description ==

Recolt datas by post with post_meta and display it with the Api Google chart statistics on each post and page in your administration. 2 pages admin exists for home page and by categories in dashboard > statistics menu

In the futur, maybe the plugin creates some humanized and dynamics things (like - by user - "yours prefered categories", "you most visited categories" and some other kinds of this kind of things in some widgets). Also task crons to make comparison. Some of this kind of build is already under construction.

Currently, the plugin requests only if is not your home page and the time to creates all the datas is ~250 ms. The plugin have an option to decrease request by user like 1/2 or 1/5 or 1/10 users, etc...

I think ~250ms it is too much. When my skill is up to date too with other technical knownledge with wordpress I will make some update.
